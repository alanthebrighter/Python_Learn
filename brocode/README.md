# BroCode Python Learning Repository

Welcome to my **BroCode Python Learning Repository**! This repository documents my journey through the [BroCode Python course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKHEtdqhLK8), where I explore and practice Python programming concepts. It serves as both a personal reference and a resource for others who are also learning Python.

---

## Objective

The primary goal of this repository is to track my progress and growth in Python programming. By organizing my code, exercises, and projects, I aim to create a structured archive that reflects my understanding of Python concepts over time. This repository also highlights challenges I've faced and how I overcame them, making it a transparent record of my learning process.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders and files that correspond to specific topics or projects covered in the course. Here's a brief overview of what you'll find:

- **Practice/Exercises**: Solutions to coding challenges and exercises from the course.
- **Projects**: Larger projects that integrate multiple concepts, showcasing practical applications of Python.
- **Notes**: (Optional) Personal notes or explanations for complex topics, if applicable.

Each file includes comments and documentation to explain the purpose and functionality of the code.
